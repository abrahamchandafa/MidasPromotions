Michael Learns To Rock was formed in the spring of 1988 by singer and keyboard player JASCHA RICHTER (born 1963), drummer KÅRE WANSCHER (born 1969), guitarist MIKKEL LENTZ (born 1968) and bassist SØREN MADSEN (born 1967).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn that summer the band won a local talent competition and started out on a nearly-two-years-long tour around Denmark. Playing wherever possible, winning an ever-growing audience and having both talent and musical skills, the songs sharpened along the way. After months of hard work in the studio, the band released their self-titled debut album in September 1991.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAmong the fine songs on the album is the smash hit “The Actor” that got wall-to-wall airplay from Danish radio stations and helped the album reach the top of the Danish sales chart in January 1992.

The up-tempo hit “Something You Should Know” led the way for the fourth studio album “Nothing To Lose” which was released in 1997. The albums turned the band into superstars in South Africa.

Two weeks later, Perri penned the first song for head or heart, her second album. In matters of love, should you rely on your heart or your head? This is the question Christina Perri posed as she began writing her second album, a collection of cathartic songs that seek to reconcile how we make decisions in love and life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPerri’s career bounded forward after she performed her triple-platinum single “Jar of Hearts” on So You Think You Can Dance.

Produced by GRAMMY®-winning producer Joe Chiccarelli (The White Stripes, My Morning Jacket) – lovestrong. entered the SoundScan/Billboard 200 among the top 5 upon its initial release, while also proving an unqualified international sensation with top 5 success in Australia and Ireland as well as top 10 sales in Canada and the United Kingdom. Perri was named as iTunes’ “Breakthrough Pop Artist of 2011.” This was followed by the 4x-platinum single “A Thousand Years” which was featured on Summit Entertainment/Chop Shop/Atlantic’s The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn–Part 1&amp;2-Original Motion Picture Soundtracks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was a whirlwind and it’s brought Perri to where she is now.

        "description": "\u003Cp\u003EThe singer’s first album, lovestrong., grappled with the aftermath of a breakup, signaling Perri as an honest, genuine artist ready to share her emotional journey with her fans. That disc, released in 2011, was bolstered by the success of Perri’s single “Jar of Hearts” and led the musician into nine tours over 27 months.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHer final show supporting lovestrong. took place on October 9, 2012 at Los Angeles’s iconic Hollywood Bowl with Jason Mraz. Two weeks later, Perri penned the first song for head or heart, her second album. In matters of love, should you rely on your heart or your head? This is the question Christina Perri posed as she began writing her second album, a collection of cathartic songs that seek to reconcile how we make decisions in love and life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPerri’s career bounded forward after she performed her triple-platinum single “Jar of Hearts” on So You Think You Can Dance. She quickly found herself signed to Atlantic Records, creating her debut album, a bittersweet collection of songs about love and loss thereof. Produced by GRAMMY®-winning producer Joe Chiccarelli (The White Stripes, My Morning Jacket) – lovestrong. entered the SoundScan/Billboard 200 among the top 5 upon its initial release, while also proving an unqualified international sensation with top 5 success in Australia and Ireland as well as top 10 sales in Canada and the United Kingdom. Perri was named as iTunes’ “Breakthrough Pop Artist of 2011.” This was followed by the 4x-platinum single “A Thousand Years” which was featured on Summit Entertainment/Chop Shop/Atlantic’s The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn–Part 1&amp;2-Original Motion Picture Soundtracks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was a whirlwind and it’s brought Perri to where she is now. The singer has embraced the platform success brings and spends any possible moment involved with several nonprofit and charity organizations. She remains deeply involved with To Write Love On Her Arms, which helps people dealing with suicidal thoughts, and visits children’s hospitals to spend time with kids grappling with depression. She’s also on the board of the Voice Health Institute, an organization she became involved with after going through vocal chord surgery in 2011.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003Ehead or heart asks a question and offers a possible responses to that query. It seeks to understand the reality of love and how we process it. It contains thoughts we’ve all thought, articulated more clearly in Perri’s strikingly compelling music and powerhouse vocals. For Perri, this album reflects where she is right now, what she’s experiencing in the present and resonates with her genuine truth. Mostly, though, it opens her to the chapter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E“All my dreams came true when touring on lovestrong.,” the singer says. “And now I’ve dreamt up all new dreams. I’m excited most because I don’t know what’s going to happen. Three years ago I was working at a café so who knows where I’ll be in three more years. I have this album and everything else is a surprise.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.christinaperri.com/%E2%80%8E\"\u003Ewww.christinaperri.com/‎\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/ChristinaPerriMusic\"\u003Ewww.facebook.com/ChristinaPerriMusic\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/christinaperri\"\u003Ewww.twitter.com/christinaperri\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://instagram.com/christinaperri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Einstagram.com/christinaperri\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E",

It’s a great thing to have that broad appeal. It’ll give us longevity.” “It feels like a festival crowd every time,” adds Glen. Such was the impact of The Script’s newfound live power. “That sound on #3 – we were loud and proud,” says Danny with well-earned satisfaction. “We’d spent a couple of tours trying to perfect the stadium-filling sound. And we found it with Hall Of Fame. And it was amazing to get to that on our third album – most bands these days don’t even get to their second album.” The Script’s fourth album, No Sound Without Silence, is the sound of a band firing on all cylinders and channelling the momentum of their last, rocket-powered campaign.

The Script have done especially well Stateside, where they have 5 Platinum singles and have sold over 1 million albums. Their #3 world tour spanned 11 months, and saw them play sold out arena shows in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia including 2 shows at London’s O2 Arena.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.thescriptmusic.com/%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%8E\"\u003Ewww.thescriptmusic.com/‎\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TheScript\"\u003Ewww.facebook.com/TheScript\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/thescript\"\u003Ewww.twitter.com/thescript\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://instagram.com/thescriptofficial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Einstagram.com/thescriptofficial\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"mb-5\"\u003E\u003C/div\u003E",

        "description": "\u003Cdiv class=\"my-5\"\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the most successful British bands of the last two decades, Blur have won a total of five BRIT Awards, and were twice nominated for the Mercury Music Award. In 2009, Blur reconvened as a four-piece to play a series of UK shows including two sold out dates at Hyde Park and a historic Sunday night appearance at Glastonbury.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBlur were formed in 1989 by Damon Albarn, Graham Coxon, Alex James and Dave Rowntree and signed with Food/EMI the same year. The band’s first taste of success came from debut album Leisure in 1991. The following years Blur released what are now regarded as classics: Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995) – albums that helped propel the band to mass popularity in the UK and beyond. The eponymous Blur was released in 1997 and seventh album Think Tank (2003) was Blur’s first as a three-piece after the temporary departure of founding guitarist Graham Coxon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt all seems like yesterday when Blur was in Hong Kong two years ago. Fans in Hong Kong were treated to a pleasant surprise when the band announced on stage that they had a few days off in Hong Kong. And soon it turned into spotting of the band travelling the city in MTR and that they were recording in a studio in Kowloon! Then it all went quiet for a long, long time and finally, early this year the band announced the release of the album ‘The Magic Whip’, featuring songs that came from their recording sessions in Hong Kong.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe recordings, which began during a five-day break in touring in Spring 2013 – at Avon Studios in Kowloon, Hong Kong – were put aside when the group finished touring and returned to their respective lives. Last November Graham Coxon revisited the tracks and, drafting in blur’s early producer Stephen Street, he worked with the band on the material. Albarn then added lyrics and the 12 tracks of The Magic Whip are the result.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"articleImg\"\u003E\u003Cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://midasolder.local/events/blur-the-magic-whip-tour-live-in-hong-kong-2015/images/blog/blur_770.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.blur.co.uk/\"\u003Ewww.blur.co.uk \u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFacebook: \u003Ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/Blur\"\u003EBlur \u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETwitter: \u003Ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/blurofficial\"\u003E@blurofficial \u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EInstagram: \u003Ca href=\"http://instagram.com/blurofficial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E@blurofficial\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"mb-5\"\u003E\u003C/div\u003E",

        "description": "\u003Cp\u003EGrammy nominated artist Charlie Puth will perform in Singapore 10 August!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECharlie Puth is an American singer, songwriter, arranger, and record producer who began his career writing his own songs and eventually posting them on YouTube, along with covers. In 2011, Ellen DeGeneres tapped Puth and a friend to appear on her show after their cover of Adele’s “Someone Like You” went viral. Puth appeared on the show twice and watched his international fan base grow both on and offline. “It got me in front of 30 million people,” he says of the experience. “It pushed me into a different area I never thought I would reach.” In 2015, Puth signed with Atlantic Records and co-wrote, co-produced, and was featured on Wiz Khalifa’s Furious 7 ballad “See You Again” — a 4x-platinum smash that topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 12 weeks, tying the record for the longest run at No. 1 for a rap song, and became No. 1 in over 100 countries, while its video racked up more than a billion YouTube views. He followed that up with the British chart-topper “Marvin Gaye,” featuring Meghan Trainor, which gave Puth another platinum record and his second Top 40 hit in the U.S. Puth received an impressive three GRAMMY nominations in 2016, including the coveted ‘Song of the Year’ category that specifically recognizes songwriters. He wrote and produced songs for an array of A-list pop and urban artists, including Lil Wayne, Jason Derulo, Stevie Wonder, Megan Trainor, Trey Songz, and Fergie, among others. Entertainment Weekly called him “the next big thing in music,” while Forbes predicted Puth would become “a global superstar” — a forecast that seemed to be borne out during his promo tours in Europe and Asia. Puth has since worked with Max Martin on Nine Track Mind’s “Then There’s You” and returned to Ellen DeGeneres’ show to perform “See You Again” with Wiz Khalifa. As the final touch on the album, Charlie’s good friend and pop singer Selena Gomez added her vocals to the song “We Don’t Talk Anymore”. Catch Charlie Puth ‘Nine Track Mind Tour’ in Singapore this 10 August at The Coliseum!

        "description": "\u003Cp\u003EIrish-Filipina pop songstress ANDREAH is back with a new single following the successful reception of her previous singles, I just miss you, which was featured in the Filipino hit TV show “He’s into her”, Dream and Best Friend. A pop ballad of heartbreak and self-discovery, “Let Me Go Easy” by ANDREAH is now available on all streaming platforms. Having acquired over two and a half million streams to date and over 160,000 monthly listeners on the popular music streaming platform, Spotify, the singer- songwriter shares that the track was inspired by spending 21 days alone in hotel quarantine; she states that she wanted to write a song about learning to love yourself, as “you are the only person you can always rely on”. The song came to life after she wanted to film herself writing a song to show her fans her songwriting process. “I felt really alone towards the end of quarantine as I spent over 18 days in isolation, so I decided to write a song as I knew that writing music would always make me feel better. I challenged myself to write the song while being filmed &#8211; at first the camera really bothered me as I was quite shy, but after I started getting into the groove by channeling all of the emotions I felt at the time, I was able to finish the song in 45 minutes,” shares ANDREAH. ANDREAH has collaborated with LA-based producer, Justin Stanley on this new track. Justin has previously produced the likes of Paul McCartney/ Prince/ Eric Clapton/ Sheryl Crow/ Beck/ Leonard Cohen/ Snoop Dogg and others. After being recommended to ANDREAH through a connection, Justin listened to all 30 of ANDREAH’s original song demos and picked “Let Me Go Easy” as the one he saw the most potential in. ANDREAH states that “Justin is one of the most talented producers she has ever met &#8211; he managed to capture all of her emotions perfectly, without even meeting her in person!” After remotely working on the song together for over a month, it is now out for the world to hear.\u003C/p\u003E",

Presented by Midas Promotions and Wilbros Live. Tickets go on-sale on August 10, 10AM via TicketNet.com.ph and TicketNet outlets nationwide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter reuniting for select shows with The Script family in 2023, the band is ready to hit the road and head out to big stages of their own. This will see them play to over 2 million fans around the world this year and more next year. The Script will be performing their biggest hits and fan favourites from their six studio albums like “The Man Who Can’t Be Moved”, “Breakeven”, “For The First Time”, “Hall of Fame”, “Superheroes”, and songs from their highly anticipated new album ‘Satellites’ featuring the new hit song “Both Ways”.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGlen Power says, “.. we’re The Script, and now we have something to prove: that there is life and light after the darkness.” Vowing to pay tribute to their friend (Mark Sheehan) by continuing the band they had built together, vocalist Danny O’Donoghue returned to the studio and experimented in a number of ways. What emerged is ‘Satellites’, an utterly uplifting collection of songs that forges a new future for The Script while remembering that although Mark may no longer be here, he remains a vital part of everything that they do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDanny explains, “The album cover is silhouettes of me, Glen and Ben Sargeant, our bassist.. Then we have a hooded silhouette, because the air of Mark is still there. He always will be, but it&#8217;s also giving a tip of the hat to the future. It&#8217;ll never be the same Script. We&#8217;re just trying to get on and do what it is that we all feel is the next right thing to do and that’s to keep making more great music.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAraneta ColiseumTickets On-Sale: Aug 10 Sat 10AM\u003Ca style=\"color: #1155cc; display: inline; margin: 0px;\" href=\"http://ticketnet.com.ph/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR11QviJJDQF4T1IWfPExHrgUEpMgwuJqvA64IUvUbKR9LDO6MTaHF3R1KQ_aem_tChxXDj_96r_78Gvfb0lKw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ticketnet.com.ph/?fbclid%3DIwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR11QviJJDQF4T1IWfPExHrgUEpMgwuJqvA64IUvUbKR9LDO6MTaHF3R1KQ_aem_tChxXDj_96r_78Gvfb0lKw&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1723470399409000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3PVV85YmVQY2mumC1057H2\"\u003ETicketNet.com.ph\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003Eand TicketNet outlets\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E",

Their second album, Talk On Corners led with I Never Loved You Anyway, So Young and Only When I Sleep and is their biggest selling album to date.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPerforming tracks from the acclaimed album plus a selection of their greatest hits to fans during the tour, the multi-million selling sibling quartet will kick off the tour at Belfast’s SSE Arena before heading to Manchester’s AO Arena, Glasgow’s OVO Hydro and Newcastle’s Utilita Arena.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe tour announcement follows news that the band – whose biggest hits include Runaway, What Can I Do?
